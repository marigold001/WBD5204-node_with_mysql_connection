# node-and-mysql

Create a node server and connect it to a MySQL database. The database will already be equipped with an Users table, full of data. You will have two endpoints, `/users` showing a list of all the users from the database and `/user/1` which allows us to specify a specific id in order to get all the data about a single user. Of course all the output is JSON based.
